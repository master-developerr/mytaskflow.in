# MyTaskFlow 🚀

MyTaskFlow is a lightweight, modern project and task management platform designed for **individuals and small agencies** who want clarity, speed, and control—without the overhead of enterprise tools.

It starts as a **personal productivity tool by default** and smoothly scales into a **collaborative agency workspace** using a simple agency-code system.

# mytaskflow

mytaskflow is a discipline-first productivity system that helps users break distraction loops by enforcing action before access.

Unlike traditional productivity apps that focus on planning, lists, or motivation, mytaskflow is built around one principle:

> **Distraction is a privilege. It must be earned through effort.**

## 🧠 What is mytaskflow?

mytaskflow blocks distracting apps or flows until the user completes **one meaningful, effortful action** that genuinely moves their work or life forward.

It is not a task manager.
It is not a planner.
It is a behavior-enforcement system.

The product is inspired by modern research around dopamine, habit formation, and deep work — designed for people who are tired of negotiating with themselves.
